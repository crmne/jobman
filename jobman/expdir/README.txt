These files are meant to house experiment-type specific worker routines.

Once we have a standard notion of what a Job is, it would make sense for each to
provide standard methods for working with them:
 - listing all jobs in the experiment
 - checking for existance of similar/identical jobs
 - adding new jobs to an experiment
