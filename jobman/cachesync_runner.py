    '''
    Used to make sure we don't rsync from the two sides at the same
    time. Relies on DistributedLock, below, which itself relies on 
    the "lockfile" utility under UNIX.

    Doesn't do anything when lockfile is not available on target
    machine (ie. cluster node).

    Example usage:
    from __future__ import with_statement
    with cachesync_lock("target_machine", "/tmp/tmpDaiDWEC"):
        # do stuff, notably rsync
        # lock will be released automatically after the "with"

    which will create the lock /tmp/tmpDaiDWEC_cachesync_lock
    on machine "target_machine" through SSH.

    Parameters
    ----------
    host_string : str
        See DistributedLock
    tmp_dir_to_lock : str
        Directory in which files are cached locally, on the node.
        This is used as a basis for the lockfile name; we simply
        append "_cachesync_lock" to this path, obtaining a file
        name.

        This therefore requires that we can create files in the
        parent directory.

        Used to make sure we don't rsync from the two sides at the same
        time. Yet this could also be used for other locks, if the need
        ever arises.

        Uses the UNIX 'lockfile' utility on the node where the job is
        executing. It should work properly as we're using a local file in the
        /tmp directory of the node.

        Parameters
        ----------
        host_string : str or None
            String to use in calling SSH to connect to the node, e.g. 
            "username:password@my.node.address", or None
            if it's called from the job itself (ie. locally on the node)
        lock_path : str
            Path of the file to use. MUST BE IN A LOCAL DIRECTORY such
            as /tmp, otherwise there might be synchronization problems
            (and there would be no point in using these locks).
            Obviously both the local node and the remote host should
            use the same lock_path.
        force_if_older : int
            Force acquiring the lock if more than this number of minutes
            have passed since its creation (in case where the other caller
            crashed).
        retries : int
            Number of retries. Default combination of retries and sleeptime
            should be enough to outlive force_if_older, so the case where
            lock truly fails should almost be non existent (if ssh works).
        sleeptime : int
            Number of time (in minutes) to wait before retrying to create
            the file.

    Syncs the working directory of jobs with remote cache.

    Usage: cachesync [options] <path_to_job(s)_workingdir(s)>

    (For this to work, though, you need to do a channel.save() at least
    once in your job before calling cachesync, otherwise the host_name
    and host_workdir won't be set in current.conf)

    It can either sync a single directory, which must contain "current.conf"
    file which specifies the remote host and directory. Example for a single
    directory:

        # this syncs the current directory
        jobman cachesync .

        # this syncs another directory
        jobman cachesync myexperiment/mydbname/mytablename/5

    It can also sync all subdirectories of the directory you specify.
    You must use the -m (or --multiple) option for this.
    Each subdirectory (numbered 1, 2 ... etc based on job number) must
    contain a "current.conf" file specifying the remote host and directory.
    Examples:

        # syncs all subdirectories 1, 2 ...
        jobman cachesync -m myexperiment/mydbname/mytablename 

    Normally completed jobs (status = DONE) won't be synced based on
    the "status" set in current.conf. Yet you can force sync by using
    the -f or --force option.

The reason I use manual tests is that it's much easier to run concurrency tests like these is that the test setup would be very complicated otherwise (need to insert jobs in db, get called back through 'jobman sql' etc.).

Description of manual tests:

First, create a lot of jobs which will call the function above through the sql runner:

jobman sqlschedules  postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db/tests_cachesync3 jobman.cachesync_runner.manualtest_lockandwait_jobman_experiment 'myparam={{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40}}'

This should be enough, otherwise just add to the list. To run one of them, place yourself in a temporary directory and run:

jobman sql postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db/tests_cachesync3 .

Before proceeding, set:
* CACHESYNC_VERBOSE = True, above
* uncomment lines containing "cachesync_runner.manualtest..." in sql_runner.py

Now, the test cases:

* To check that...

    * TEST 1: we can't run cachesync while channel.save() is running
        * set TEST1 = True above
        * from some shell (shell 1) call jobman sql (above)
        * in another shell (shell 2), place yourself in the directory of the job (check its number)
        * then call "jobman cachesync ." (in shell 2)
        * this should wait about 1 minute, then leave with an error message saying that rsync could not run as the directory as now been deleted
        * reset TEST1 = False

    * TEST 2: we can't run channel.save() while cachesync is running
        * set TEST2 = True above
        * from some shell (shell 1) call jobman sql as above
            * now you have ~100 secs to run the instructions below
        * in another shell (shell 2), place yourself in the directory of the job (check its number)
        * then call "jobman cachesync ." (in shell 2)
        * in shell 1, the current save() should be waiting for the lock
        * when job in shell 2 finishes, job in shell 1 should finish too
        * check in stdout to see if the last delay for save() was more then 5 seconds, something around 65 seconds in fact
        * set TEST2 = False above

    * TEST 3: we can't delete temporary directory while cachesync is running
        * set TEST3 = True above
        * from some shell (shell 1) call jobman sql as above
        * you should see a message saying that you have 30 secs before the delete
        * in another shell (shell 2), place yourself in the directory of the job (check its number)
        * then call "jobman cachesync -f ." (in shell 2)
            * notice the -f, as the job is now marked as status = COMPLETE
            * this should sleep for 60 secs
        * the delay printed (see stdout file) should be more than 30, something ~70 secs
        * set TEST3 = False

 
    * TEST 4: we can't run cachesync while temporary directory is being deleted
        * TBD, not a very important case
