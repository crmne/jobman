# here, you would import the function that implements your job.
# This should be one of the jobman-compatible functions that takes
# arguments (state, channel)

# One reason not to put this function into this very file is that in practice,
# it can be handy to record a version number (such as the mercurial version
# hash) as part of the result of a job.  That way, when analyzing things much
# later, you can see right away what version of your code produced a given
# result.  If your version number changes every time you add a job or tweak an
# analysis function (i.e. list_all), then you will see many different version
# numbers among your experiments, even though the file with the function being
# tested didn't change at all.  This can be confusing.
from jobman.examples.def_addition import addition_example


# here we build a list of dictionaries, each of which specifies a setting of
# parameters corresponding to one job.
#
# We will pass this list to mydriver.main, so that it can potentially insert
# them, or trim down the database to match the current list, and other sorts of
# things.

#
# mydriver.main defines a few commands that are generally useful (insert,
# clear_db, summary, etc.) but if you want to analyse your results you can add
# additional commands.
#
# For example, if you type 'python additional_driver.py list_all', then this little function will run, because its function name is 'list_all'.
#
# For help on the meaning of the various elements of `kwargs`, see <WRITEME>.
