Installing Jobman
=================

To install Jobman from within the LISA laboratory:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone ssh://projects@lgcm.iro.umontreal.ca/hg/Jobman

To install Jobman from the outside world:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone http://lgcm.iro.umontreal.ca/hg/Jobman

This will create a local ``Jobman/`` folder which you should add to your
``PYTHON_PATH`` environment variable. For ease of use, you should also add
``Jobman/jobman/bin`` to your ``PATH`` variable.

Installation of PostgreSQL Support (optional)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

One central feature of Jobman is to store all the information regarding
jobs to launch, jobs currently running, and results of finished jobs, in
one database.

In order to use that feature, you'll need to have some software installed on
the central server (mainly a PostgreSQL server).

Requirements on the server side
-------------------------------

A running PostgreSQL_ server, with:

* a database, let's say ``jobbase``
* a username and password, for instance ``jobmanager`` and ``53|<r37``

The user should have the right to connect to this database, and to
connect from a remote host if the client will run on another machine.

You can test your database connection using the following command::

    psql -l host -u <user>

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/

Requirements on the client side
-------------------------------

The ``jobman`` executable, that you will run on some client computer,
also has some software requirements.

Jobman depends on:

* python (version?)
* SQLAlchemy
* psycopg2

For Jobman to automatically connect to the database, you should also create
the file ``~/.jobman_<dbname>`` in your home directory, which contains your
database password in plain-text [1]_ (!)  Note that
``open(<file>).read()`` should return the password string, so be
mindful of whitespace and line-break characters.

.. [1] For this reason, you may want to avoid using your normal everyday passwords...
