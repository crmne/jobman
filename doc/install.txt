Installing Jobman
=================

To install Jobman, you have to clone the development Mercurial repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/jobman Jobman

This will create a local ``Jobman/`` folder which you should add to your
``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. For ease of use, you should also add
``Jobman/bin`` to your ``PATH`` variable.

Installation of PostgreSQL Support (optional)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

One central feature of Jobman is to store all the information regarding
jobs to launch, jobs currently running, and results of finished jobs, in
one database.

In order to use that feature, you'll need to have some software installed on
the central server (mainly a PostgreSQL server).

Requirements on the server side
-------------------------------

A running PostgreSQL_ server, with:

* a database, let's say ``jobbase``
* a username and password, for instance ``jobmanager`` and ``53|<r37``

The user should have the right to connect to this database, and to
connect from a remote host if the client will run on another machine.

You can test your database connection using the following command::

    psql -l host -u <user>

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/

Requirements on the client side
-------------------------------

The ``jobman`` executable, that you will run on some client computer,
also has some software requirements.

Jobman depends on:

* python >= 2.5 and < 3
* SQLAlchemy
* psycopg2

For Jobman to automatically connect to the database, you should also
create a `password file`_ named ``~/.pgpass`` in your home directory, which contains
lines in this format: ``hostname:port:database:username:password``. You
can put ``*`` in any of those field. Example
``psql.example.com:*:jobbase:jobmanager:53|<r37``. This will work for
jobman and for psql.

An old way of doing the same only for jobman is with the file
``~/.jobman_<dbname>`` in your home directory, which contains your
database password in plain-text [1]_ (!)  Note that their must be only
1 line in that file and it must end with a new line.

.. [1] For this reason, you may want to avoid using your normal everyday passwords...
