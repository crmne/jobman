About Jobman
==============

The goal of Jobman is to facilitate the process of launching many concurrent
jobs, by automatically handling how parameters are passed to your programs and
how results are stored for further analysis. While Jobman is
application-agnostic, it is particularly well suited for machine learning
when performing model selection (handling of hyperparameters, storing and
analyzing results).

Jobman has two basic modes. It can be used directly from the command line
(which will rely mostly on flat-files for data storage) or it can be combined
with a PostreSQL database for more intensive applications.
