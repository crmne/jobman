Multilayer Perceptron with Jobman
=================================

.. note::
    This section assumes the reader has already read through the
    `MLP tutorial <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/tutorial/mlp.html>`_ and
    through the documentation of `Jobman`_. You should be familiar with the 
    state/channel variable notions, the sql/sqlschedule(s) commands. You 
    should also be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

.. note::
    The code for this section is available for download in the examples
    directory, under mlp_jobman.py

.. _Jobman: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/jobmandoc


In this part of the tutorial, we will explore the way Jobman can be used for
exploring the hyper-parameters of an MLP. As we saw, these hyper-parameters are (in
decreasing order of importance):

 * learning rate
 * number of hidden units
 * minibatch size
 * number of training epochs
 * L1/L2 penalty

This tutorial was written as a self-containing, complete example of performing 
hyper-parameter exploration with Jobman.

Adding the experiment method
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We need a method that takes as inputs a state and a channel variable. The simplest
way to do that with our existing code is to simply add a method that reads in the 
hyper-parameters from the state variable and passes them to the method that
does the optimization:

.. code-block:: python

    def experiment(state,channel):

        (best_validation_loss, test_score, minutes_trained, iter) = \
            sgd_optimization_mnist(state.learning_rate, state.n_hidden, state.L1_reg,
                state.L2_reg, state.batch_size, state.n_iter)

        state.best_validation_loss = best_validation_loss
        state.test_score = test_score
        state.minutes_trained = minutes_trained
        state.iter = iter
        return channel.COMPLETE


Note that we have modified the sgd_optimization_mnist method to return a tuple containing
the best validation loss, the corresponding test score, the number of minutes that
training took and the iteration at which we obtained the best validation score. This
tuple is then added to the state variable.


Scheduling jobs
+++++++++++++++

We present two ways of scheduling jobs in the database, for later
execution. The first method uses the command-line and a configuration
file, the more advanced one uses a Python script.

First method: command-line and configuration file
-------------------------------------------------

Creating the configuration file
...............................

A good practice is to keep a flat file with the default values for the hyperparameters. 
For example, mlp_jobman.conf contains:

.. literalinclude:: ../jobman/examples/mlp_jobman.conf

The reason this is good practice is because in many cases we will be exploring only a few 
of the hyper-parameters at a time, rather than changing them all at the same time.

Scheduling one job
..................

The following command

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman sqlschedule  postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi \
                    mlp_jobman.experiment mlp_jobman.conf

will 

 * read in the configuration stored in mlp_jobman.conf
 * create the table mlp_dumi in database ift6266h10_sandbox_db on gershwin (using the account ift6266h10 and the password stored in ~/.pgpass)
 * populate the table with the values inferred from mlp_jobman.conf
 * "schedule" mlp_jobman.experiment to run with these values

The output of this function is

.. code-block:: bash

   ADDING   {'n_iter': 10, 'jobman.experiment': 'mlp_jobman.experiment',
    'jobman.status': 0, 'jobman.sql.priority': 1.0, 'L1_reg': 0.0, 'learning_rate':
    0.01, 'n_hidden': 100, 'batch_size': 20, 'L2_reg': 0.0001}

basically giving us a detailed overview of the job that was just added to the table. 
You will notice that jobman inserted a couple of different fields:

 * jobman.experiment: the name of the module.method that took the (state,
   channel) as input
 * jobman.status: the status of the job (0 = not started, 1 = incomplete, 2 =
   complete, 3 = err while starting, 4 = err while syncing, 5 = job error, -1 = canceled)
 * jobman.sql.priority: the priority at which the job will be scheduled.
   Higher number == higher priority.


Scheduling more than one job
............................

The following command

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman sqlschedules  postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi mlp_jobman.experiment\
          mlp_jobman.conf 'n_hidden={{20,30}}'

will populate the mlp_dumi table with values inferred from mlp_jobman.conf **and** the ones given on the command line. The n_hidden variable values are expanded, so the output is:

.. code-block:: bash

    [['mlp_jobman.conf', 'n_hidden=20'], ['mlp_jobman.conf', 'n_hidden=30']] [['n_hidden=20'], ['n_hidden=30']]
    ADDING   {'n_iter': 10, 'jobman.experiment': 'mlp_jobman.experiment', 'jobman.status': 0, 'jobman.sql.priority': 1.0, 'L1_reg': 0.0, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'n_hidden': 20, 'batch_size': 20, 'L2_reg': 0.0001}
    ADDING   {'n_iter': 10, 'jobman.experiment': 'mlp_jobman.experiment', 'jobman.status': 0, 'jobman.sql.priority': 1.0, 'L1_reg': 0.0, 'learning_rate': 0.01, 'n_hidden': 30, 'batch_size': 20, 'L2_reg': 0.0001}

This shows how to keep default values for the parameters in a .conf file and add jobs corresponding to multiple values of a given (set of) hyperparameter(s).


Scheduling with random value
............................

If you to do random search of the hyper-paramter, you can do if with the key:=value syntax like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman sqlschedules  postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi mlp_jobman.experiment\
          mlp_jobman.conf 'n_hidden={{20,30}}' "learning_rate:=@numpy.random.uniform(1e-6, 1e-1)"



Create a view
.............

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman sqlview postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi mlp_dumi_view

This creates a virtual table called mlp_dumi_view for later viewing and
interpreting results (see below). Note that each time a new field is
added to `state`, the view should be recreated. For instance, if you
create the view before any job is finished, the table will not contain
the `best_validation_loss` column, and if you want to use it you will
have to call ``jobman sqlview ...`` once again after one job finishes.

Advanced method: Python script
------------------------------

Since Jobman is a Python package, we can easily call functions from a
Python script, allowing us more flexibility when inserting jobs.

The main differences with the first approach are:

* The values of the hyperparameters are in some dictionary-like object,
  not read from another configuration file (of course, you can have Python
  code that reads values from a conf file):

  .. code-block:: python

    state = DD()
    state.learning_rate = 0.01
    state.L1_reg = 0.00
    state.L2_reg=0.0001
    state.n_iter=50
    state.batch_size=20
    state.n_hidden=10

* The jobs are inserted in the database one by one:

  .. code-block:: python

    sql.insert_job(experiment, flatten(state), db)

Here is a script that explore different values for n_hidden, and for
the L1 and L2 regularization coefficients, without using both type of
regularizations at the same time in an experiment. This would not be
possible with one call to ``jobmah sqlschedules``, because it would
explore all the combinations of hyperparameter values.

.. literalinclude:: ../jobman/examples/mlp_jobman_insert.py


Executing jobs
++++++++++++++

If you simply execute

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman sql 'postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi' .

at the command line, jobman connects to the database and retrieves a job that:

    * has not been executed yet
    * has the highest priority (or lowest job ID)

and then actually runs it locally.

Using jobdispatch
-----------------

The question is now how to run jobs in parallel on a cluster. Jobman
now comes with a script called ``jobdispatch``, that schedules jobs on
a variety of back-ends, including condor at DIRO.  In fact, it is quite
simple:

.. code-block:: bash

    jobdispatch --condor --repeat_jobs=3 jobman sql 'postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi' .

The different options mean:

 * `--condor`: will launch on the condor system (clusters and workstations seen as compute servers) at DIRO
 * `--repeat_jobs=3`: how many copies of ``jobman sql 'postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi' .`` it should launch
 * `jobman sql 'postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi' .` - the command to launch

This is perhaps slightly confusing. What should be understood is that
``jobdispatch`` has no knowledge of the job that should be executed. So, without
the `--repeat_jobs=3` parameter, it would simply launch **1** jobman command on a
condor machine. When `--repeat_jobs` is 3, ``jobdispatch`` launches the jobman
command **3** times (on 3 different machines). Each of these jobman commands
will try to fetch a task from the database and each will get a different task,
even if the requests are sent at the same time (because of the atomicity of
database transactions).

To add to the confusion, jobman has itself a mechanism for running more than
one job, but in **sequential** manner. For instance, the following command
will launch 3 tasks on the condor cluster. Each of them will execute jobman
with the given parameters. These parameters say that each task will fetch up to 5
jobs from the database and run them sequentially. 

.. code-block:: bash

    dbidispatch --condor --repeat_jobs=3 jobman sql -n 5 'postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi' .

Assuming that there are at least 15 tasks in the database, they will all be
executed after a while. Note that if n<=0 then each task will run as many jobs
as possible (i.e. it will keep trying to fetch jobs from the database as long
as there are some left).

The reason these two options exist separately is to allow a certain degree of
trade-off between the number of machines used to execute jobs vs. the number
of jobs per machine.


Canceling/Restarting jobs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   jobman sqlstatus [--all] [--print=KEY] [--print-keys] [--status=JOB_STATUS] [--set_status=JOB_STATUS] [--resert_prio] [--select=key=value] [--quiet] [--ret_nb_jobs] postgres://ift6266h10@gershwin/ift6266h10_sandbox_db?table=mlp_dumi JOB_ID1, JOB_ID2, ...

* Default: only print the current status of those jobs.
* `--all`: add all jobs in the db to the list of jobs.
* `--print=KEY`: print the value of KEY of jobs in the db. Accept multiple --print option.
* `--print-keys`: print the keys in the state of the first job.
* `--status=JOB_STATUS`: Query the db and add jobs with the status JOB_STATUS to the list jobs.
* `--set_status=JOB_STATUS`: print and change the status of jobs.to CANCELED. 
    * --set_status=CANCELED: This means that  `jobman sql` won't start those jobs.
      If the jobs are 
      already running, when the jobs finish it will change the status to START 
      or DONE depending of what it return. If the already running jobs crash,
      it won't change the status.
    * --set_status=START: This means that `jobman sql` will start those jobs again.
* `--reset_prio`: put the priority of jobs back to the default value.
* `--select=key=value`: Query the db and add jobs that match all select parameter to the list of jobs.
* `--quiet`: less verbose
* `--ret_nb_jobs`: print only the number of jobs selected.

JOB_STATUS={START,RUNNING,DONE,ERR_START,ERR_SYNC,ERR_RUN,CANCELED} or their equivelent number
