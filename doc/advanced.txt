Advanced
========

check
-----

There is the `jobman check <tablepath>` command which checks that all jobs 
marked as running in the db are marked as running in some cluster jobs scheduler.
Now we support condor and sge as cluster jobs scheduler.

It prints warnings and errors about jobs that may have crashed or have crashed. It 
is useful with `jobman sqlstatus` to restart jobs that have crashed.

cachesync
---------

Syncs the working directory of running jobs with their final experiment directory. See `jobman help cachesync` for more detail. Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    jobman cachesync [--force|-f] [--multiple|-m] [--sql] <path_to_job(s)_workingdir(s)>

reval
-----

``reval`` is an extension of Python's ``eval`` function which adds some
useful syntax elements:


- ``@a.b.c`` automatically imports the symbol ``a.b.c``.
- ``%var`` is subbed out for the variable of the same name given as a
  keyword argument to ``reval``.
- ``%%var`` is evaluated as ``state.var``

For example:


.. code-block:: python

   from jobman import reval, DD
   x = 12
   state = DD(b = 3)
   print reval("@numpy.add(%a, x) * %%b", a = 8)

   
Would print ``60`` and is equivalent to:


.. code-block:: python

   from jobman import reval
   import numpy.add
   x = 12
   state = DD(b = 3)
   a = 8
   print numpy.add(a, x) * state.b



make2
-----

``make2`` is an alternative to jobman's ``make`` command which allows
for a more advanced syntax, when passing parameters to jobman. The
main difference is that the expression following the ``::`` syntax
used for builders is evaluated using ``reval``. As it turns out,
``make2(x)`` is roughly equivalent to ``reval(x.__builder__, **x)``
(though, unlike that simple expression, ``make2`` is recursive).

An example of use of ``make2`` in an experiment function is contained
in the file ``jobman/examples/def_make2.py``. We reproduce its
contents for convenience:

.. code-block:: python

    from jobman import make2
    
    class Plumber(object):
       def __init__(self, itsa, me, mario):
            self.statement = itsa + me + mario

    def experiment(state, channel):
        exclamation_mark = '!'
        obj = make2(state.plumber)
        print obj.statement
        return channel.COMPLETE

Let us fill in a file called ``test.conf`` with the following:
      
.. code-block:: bash

   plumber :: @jobman.examples.def_make2.Plumber(%itsa, %%me, %luigi)
   plumber.itsa = "it's a "
   plumber.luigi :: "luigi" + exclamation_mark
   me = "me, "

We can then test out the feature:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ jobman cmdline jobman.examples.def_make2.experiment test.conf
    It's a me, luigi!


``%itsa`` and ``%luigi`` take the values of
``make2(state.plumber.itsa)`` and ``make2(state.plumber.luigi)``,
respectively (note that ``plumber.luigi`` has a builder (it uses ::),
yet ``plumber.itsa`` has not (it uses =); ``make2`` on an object with
no builder returns the object itself). ``%%me`` takes the value of
``state.me`` - ``make2`` is not implicitly applied to it, so it should
normally not have a builder. Furthermore, ``%%me`` only works if there
is a variable named ``state`` (unlike the notation with a single ``%``
which will work regardless of how the state variable is named). These
kludges might be worked out eventually. The ``exclamation_mark``
variable is evaluated in the scope where ``make2`` is called.

Note that due to ``Plumber`` and ``experiment`` being in the same
scope, in this example, you may simply use ``Plumber`` instead of
``@jobman.examples.def_make2.Plumber`` and it will still work as
expected. However, only the longer notation will work in all
experiments without requiring them to contain an explicit definition
or import of the ``Plumber`` symbol.



Channel Parameter
-----------------

channel is an object with the following important methods:

* channel.switch() (or channel()) will give the control back to the
  user, if it is appropriate to do so. If a call to channel.switch()
  returns the string 'stop', it typically means that the signal
  SIGTERM (or SIGINT) was received. Therefore, the experiment may be
  killed soon, so it should save and return True or
  channel.INCOMPLETE so it can be resumed later. This should be
  checked periodically or data loss may be incurred.

	The following return values are meaningful:
          * 'stop' -> the experiment must stop as soon as possible. It
                      may save what it needs to save. This occurs when 
                      SIGTERM or SIGINT are sent (or in user-defined 
		      circumstances).
          * 'finish-up' -> the experiment should continue until it
                           reaches a point where it can be restarted 
                           from (check-point), then save and exit.
          * 'save' -> the experiment should continue until it reaches
                      a check-point, then save(by calling channel.save()) 
                      and continue.

  Two options allow to control the returned value when using "jobman cmdline" and "jobman sql":

  .. code-block:: text

        --finish-up-after=FINISH_UP_AFTER
                        Duration (in seconds) after which the call to channel.switch()
			will return 'finish-up'. Asks the experiment to reach the next
                        checkpoint, save, and exit. It is up to the experiment
			to use channel.switch() and respect it.
        --save-every=SAVE_EVERY
                        Interval (in seconds) after which the call to channel.switch()
			will return 'save'. Asks the experiment to save at the next checkpoint.
			It is up to the experiment use channel.switch() and respect it.

* channel.save() will save the current state. It is automatically
  called when the function returns, but it is a good idea to do it
  periodically.

* channel.save_and_switch() is an useful shortcut to do both operations
  described above.


Reloading an erased sql db
--------------------------

There is the sqlreload jobman command that you can use if you deleted totally or
partially the sql db. It allow to reload the db from the file in the experiment
directory.

Temporary work files and the '.no_sync' suffix
----------------------------------------------

When running an experiment remotely (for instance by using the 'jobman sql' command),
jobman creates a local temporary work directory to store configuration files and other
files generated by the experiment. When calling channel.save(), jobman will rsync the 
contents of this working directory to the specified output directory. If your experiment
generates big files, and you have many experiments running at the same time, it can
become a big load for the NFS. By adding a '.no_sync' suffix to a file name (or
directory), you can bypass the rsync for this file when calling channel.save(). This is
useful if you need temporary work files. But, be careful, these files will be erased at
the end of the experiment.
