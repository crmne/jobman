Database Architecture
=====================

When inserting jobs in a database with name ``<tablename>``, Jobman actually
creates two tables. Below

``<tablename>trial``
---------------------

.. code-block:: sql

    dbname=> select * from tablenametrial LIMIT 3;
     id  | create | write | read | status | priority |         hash
    -----+--------+-------+------+--------+----------+----------------------
     568 |        |       |      |      2 |        1 |   645013771111222343
     576 |        |       |      |      2 |        1 |   151531654272445486
     249 |        |       |      |      2 |        1 | -4362188346468559166

This table is the top-level experiment table. It contains one row per job or
experiment to run. The columns of interest are:

* id: unique identifier for each job in table ``<tablename>``
* status: status of the job. As previously mentionned: 0=ready, 1=running, 2=done
* priority: higher priority jobs (high-numerical value) will be run sooner
  than low-priority jobs, when launching jobs with the ``jobman sql`` command
* hash: hash number which is meant to be unique for each job. The hash value
  is used to detect and prevent the insertion of duplicate jobs. 
  (DISCLAIMER: the hash mechanism is rather brittle and currently needs
  revisiting)
* create/write/read: unused fields

``<tablename>keyval``
---------------------

.. code-block:: sql

    dbname=> select * from tablenamekeyval LIMIT 3;
      id   | dict_id |         name          | type | ival | fval |    sval    | bval
    -------+---------+-----------------------+------+------+------+------------+------
     10811 |     206 | minimizer.__builder__ | s    |      |      | somestring |
     10812 |     206 | stopper.i_wait        | i    |   10 |      |            |
     10813 |     206 | verbose               | i    |    1 |      |            |

Columns have the following meaning:

 - id: unique identifier for each (key,value) pair (i.e. each row of the
   ``keyval`` table represents one parameter)
 - dict_id: (foreign key) id of the trial/experiment/job this (key,value) pair is associated
   with. Each row in the ``trial`` table is therefore mapped to multiple rows of
   the ``keyval`` table.
 - name: string value of the key used in the parameter list
 - type: one of ['s','i','f','b']: 

    - 's' means that the value of the key is a string and is stored in the 'sval' column. '
    - 'i' means that the value of the key is an integer and is stored in the 'ival' column. '
    - 'f' means that the value of the key is a float and is stored in the 'fval' column. '
    - 'b' means that the value of the key is a blob (binary) and is stored in the 'bval' column. '
 - ival/fval/sval/bval: one of these contains the value of the (key,value) pair
