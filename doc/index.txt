Welcome
=======

The goal of Jobman is to facilitate the process of launching many concurrent
jobs, by automatically handling how parameters are passed to your programs and
how results are stored for further analysis. While Jobman is
application-agnostic, it is particularly well suited for machine learning when
performing model selection (handling of hyperparameters, storing and analyzing
results).

Jobman has two basic modes. It can be used directly from the command line
(which will rely mostly on flat-files for data storage) or it can be combined
with a PostgreSQL database for more intensive applications.

Roughly in order of what you'll want to check out:

* :ref:`install` -- Installation instructions.
* :ref:`intro` -- The basics of Jobman.
* :ref:`cmdline` -- Learn how to use Jobman on the command line.
* :ref:`addition_exp_sql` -- Become familiar with PostgreSQL queries.
* :ref:`mlp_jobman` -- A complete example, from start to end.
* :ref:`dbarch` -- Quick tour of the database architecture underlying Jobman.
* :ref:`advanced` -- Advanced topics.
* :ref:`tips` -- Tips

You can download the latest `PDF documentation <http://deeplearning.net/software/jobman/jobman.pdf>`_, rather than reading it online.
